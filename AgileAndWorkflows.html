      <h2 class="fs-1 my-3">What is an Agile workflow?</h2>
      <p class="fs-5">
        The <a href="#">Agile</a> methodology uses iterations to complete
        project work. Instead of running the entire project in one go, an Agile
        approach allows project teams to complete work in smaller sections.
        These iterations (known as <a href="#">sprints</a>) give teams the
        flexibility to work on parts of a project, review the successes and
        failures, and update their project plan accordingly. It also allows
        project leaders, product managers, and software developers to make
        improvements and fix issues as quickly as possible. So how can this
        project management methodology fit into a workflow? The Agile workflow
        model incorporates Agile practices into your business processes. For
        example, instead of running your workflow as one continuous process,
        youâ€™ll break it down into smaller increments (sprints). At the end of
        each iteration, team members and other stakeholders (including end
        users) can provide feedback. This feedback informs the next iteration,
        allowing you to continually improve your workflow. The Agile model
        focuses on continuous improvement, allowing you to constantly update and
        improve your processes to get the best possible results for your
        business.
